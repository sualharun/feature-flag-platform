Feature Flag & Experimentation Platform
Overview
This project is a production-grade Feature Flag & Experimentation Platform built with Java and AWS. It enables teams to safely release features, perform gradual rollouts, instantly roll back changes, and experiment with user experiences — all without redeploying services.
The system is designed as an internal platform tool, similar in spirit to solutions used at companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Problem Statement
Modern software systems require fast iteration with minimal risk. Traditional deployment-based releases are:
-Risky (all users are affected at once)
-Slow to roll back
-Poorly suited for experimentation

This platform decouples feature releases from deployments, allowing runtime control over application behavior with strong guarantees around safety, performance, and reliability.

Goals
-Enable dynamic feature control at runtime
-Support safe, gradual rollouts
-Provide instant kill switches for emergency rollback
-Enable deterministic user experiences
-Lay the foundation for A/B testing and experimentation

Core Features (MVP)
-Feature Flag Management
-Create, update, and delete feature flags
-Enable or disable flags globally
-Store flag metadata (name, description, version)

Flag Evaluation
-Runtime flag evaluation via a Java SDK
-Boolean flag results (enabled / disabled)
-Deterministic evaluation (same user always gets same result)
-No application redeploy required

Percentage-Based Rollouts
-Gradual rollout from 0% to 100%
-Even traffic distribution using deterministic hashing
-User-based rollout control

Kill Switch / Emergency Rollback
-Instantly disable a feature
-Bypass cached values when necessary
-Safe rollback under partial system failure

SDK Integration
-Java SDK for flag evaluation
-Local in-memory caching with TTL
-Safe fallback defaults when service is unavailable

Data Persistence
-Persistent storage of flag configurations
-Versioned updates for rollback support
-Read-heavy, write-light optimized access pattern


Non-Functional Requirements

Performance
-Flag evaluation latency < 10ms
-Cache-first reads (no DB call per evaluation)

Reliability
-SDK continues functioning during backend outages
-Graceful degradation with fallback values
-Circuit breaker protection

Scalability
-Horizontally scalable backend services
-Stateless flag service
-Supports high read throughput

Security
-Authenticated access to flag management APIs
-No sensitive user data stored in flags
-IAM-based access control on AWS

Fault Tolerance
-Redis cache failure handling
-Retry with exponential backoff
-Safe defaults when dependencies fail

Testability
-Unit tests for flag evaluation logic
-Integration tests for API endpoints
-Deterministic behavior under test conditions

-Automated gradual rollouts

Targeting & Rules
-User targeting by attributes (region, role, environment)
-Rule priority ordering
-Sticky user assignments

Experimentation
-Multi-variant flags (A/B/C)
-Traffic splitting
-Metric tracking per variant
-Experiment duration control

Governance & Security
-Role-based access control (RBAC)
-Approval workflows for production flags
-Audit logs for flag changes

Observability
-Flag evaluation latency metrics
-Per-flag usage tracking
-Alerting on error spikes after rollout

Assumptions
-A user identifier is available at evaluation time
-Flags are small in size and frequently read
-Writes are infrequent compared to reads
